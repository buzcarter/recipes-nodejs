This creamy tomato soup is a cozy and comforting dish that is perfect for a chilly day. It's made with canned tomatoes, cream, basil, and a pinch of baking soda to reduce the acidity. The grilled cheese croutons are a fun and delicious addition that make this soup extra special. You can use any cheese you like, such as cheddar, mozzarella, or Swiss.

## INGREDIENTS

* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cans (28 ounces each) crushed tomatoes
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* Salt and pepper, to taste

### FOR THE GRILLED CHEESE CROUTONS

* 8 slices bread
* 4 tablespoons butter, softened
* 8 slices cheese

## PREPARATION

1. In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter and cook the onion and garlic until soft, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Add the tomatoes, broth, cream, basil, baking soda, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup until smooth and creamy.
4. To make the grilled cheese croutons, butter one side of each bread slice. Place four bread slices, buttered side down, on a large skillet over medium heat. Top with cheese and the remaining bread slices, buttered side up. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until golden and cheese is melted. Cut into bite-sized pieces.
5. Serve the soup with the grilled cheese croutons on top. ðŸ˜‹
