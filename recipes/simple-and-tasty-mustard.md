# Simple and Tasty Mustard
Yield: 1 cup | Total Time: 15 minutes

By Klen Ater

This mustard is easy to make with just a few ingredients, and it has a balanced flavor that is not too hot, bitter, or sweet. It has a thick and creamy texture that is perfect for spreading on sandwiches, burgers, or hot dogs. You can also use it as a dip for pretzels, fries, or nuggets. Unlike Alton Brown's recipe, this mustard does not require grinding mustard seeds, using pickle juice, or microwaving the mixture. You can adjust the amount of honey and vinegar to suit your taste and preference.

## INGREDIENTS

* 1/4 cup yellow mustard powder
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 2 tablespoons white vinegar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/8 teaspoon paprika

## PREPARATION

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard powder and water until smooth and no lumps remain.
2. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the honey, vinegar, salt, turmeric, and paprika. Stir until the honey dissolves and the mixture is warm, but not boiling.
3. Add the mustard mixture to the saucepan and whisk to combine. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until the mustard thickens to your desired consistency.
4. Transfer the mustard to a glass jar or container and let it cool completely. Store in the refrigerator for up to a month.
5. Enjoy your simple and tasty mustard! ðŸ˜‹
