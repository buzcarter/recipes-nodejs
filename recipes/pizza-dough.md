## steps
1. stir together flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl  
2. add oil and water, stir by hand (dipping in cold water occasionally) in a circular motion like a dough hook until a smooth mass forms and it clears the sides of the bowl  
3. knead dough on counter until gluten forms; should be springy and elastic, and register 50–55ºF  
4. rub baking sheet pan with olive oil  
4. cut into 6 equal pieces, pat into a round ball and place on baking sheet  
5. rub each ball with oil and cover tightly with plastic wrap  
6. place in fridge and let rest overnight  
7. two hours before making pizza, on a floured counter pat the dough into 1/2" thick discs  
8. sprinkle with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap; let sit  
9. about 45 minutes before cooking, place stone in oven and preheat to as hot as your oven will go
