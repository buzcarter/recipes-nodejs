# Pizza Dough

This dough needs to rest overnight.

You'll make six individual-sized balls of dough here; if you'd like a larger pizza, you can form the dough into larger balls.

After the dough rests, it can be refrigerated or frozen. Let it come to room temperature before dividing it into balls and letting it rise, then baking. Or the balls can be transferred to individual freezer-safe plastic food storage bags along with a drizzle of olive oil; refrigerate for several days or freeze for several months. Defrost at room temperature and let it rise before baking.

## ingredients
* 20.25 oz unbleached high-gluten, bread, or all-purpose flour (4.5 cups, chilled if possible)  
* 0.44 oz salt (1.75 tsp)  
* 0.11 oz instant yeast (1 tsp)  
* 2 oz olive oil (1/4 cup)  
* 14 oz water, ice cold (1.75 cups, 40ºF)  
* semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting  

## steps

### Night Before

1. stir together flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl  
2. add oil and water, stir by hand (dipping in cold water occasionally) in a circular motion like a dough hook until a smooth mass forms and it clears the sides of the bowl  
3. knead dough on counter until gluten forms; should be springy and elastic, and register 50–55ºF  
4. rub baking sheet pan with olive oil  
4. cut into 6 equal pieces, pat into a round ball and place on baking sheet  
5. rub each ball with oil and cover tightly with plastic wrap  
6. place in fridge and let rest overnight  

### Two Hours Prior To Baking
1. two hours before making pizza, on a floured counter pat the dough into 1/2" thick discs  
2. sprinkle with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap; let sit  
3. about 45 minutes before cooking, place stone in oven and preheat to as hot as your oven will go  
4. stretch out dough and make pizzas!  

## notes
* If dough won't stretch out, let it rest 5–20 minutes and try again
