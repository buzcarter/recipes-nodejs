By Fatti Mann

These pulled pork sandwiches are a crowd-pleaser for any occasion. The pork is cooked low and slow in a tangy and smoky sauce, until it's tender and shreddable. You can serve it on soft buns with coleslaw, pickles, and your favorite barbecue sauce. This recipe is easy to make with a slow cooker, and you can also freeze the leftovers for later.
