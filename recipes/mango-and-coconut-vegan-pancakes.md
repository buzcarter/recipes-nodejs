# Mango and Coconut Vegan Pancakes
Yield: 12 pancakes | Total Time: 30 minutes

By Krum Kake

These pancakes are a tropical delight, made with fresh mango, coconut milk, and oat flour. They are vegan, gluten-free, and naturally sweetened with maple syrup. They are fluffy, moist, and bursting with fruity flavor. You can enjoy them with more mango and coconut flakes on top, or drizzle some vegan caramel sauce for a decadent treat.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups oat flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 cup diced fresh mango, plus more for serving
* 1/4 cup shredded coconut, plus more for serving

## Steps

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the oat flour, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, maple syrup, coconut oil, and vanilla extract.
3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until well combined. Fold in the mango and coconut.
4. Heat a nonstick griddle or skillet over medium-high heat and lightly grease with some oil or vegan butter. Drop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil or butter as needed.
5. Serve the pancakes with more mango and coconut flakes, or your favorite toppings. ðŸ˜‹
