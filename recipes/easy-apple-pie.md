# Easy Apple Pie
Yield: 8 servings | Total Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

By Pipa Kokur

This apple pie is a simple and delicious dessert that you can make with store-bought pie crust and fresh or canned apples. The filling is spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice, and the crust is flaky and golden. You can serve this pie with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for a classic treat.

## INGREDIENTS

* 1 package refrigerated pie crusts, thawed
* 6 cups peeled and sliced apples, fresh or canned
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces

## PREPARATION

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Unroll one pie crust and fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim and flute the edges. Refrigerate while preparing the filling.
2. In a large bowl, toss the apples with the sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon juice. Spoon the filling into the crust and dot with butter.
3. Unroll the remaining pie crust and place it over the filling. Cut several slits on the top crust to vent steam. Press and seal the edges with the bottom crust.
4. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbly. If the crust browns too quickly, cover the edges with foil.
5. Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
6. Enjoy your easy apple pie! ðŸ˜‹
