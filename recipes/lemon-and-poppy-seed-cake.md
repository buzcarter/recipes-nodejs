* 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
* 3 large eggs, at room temperature
* 2 tablespoons lemon zest
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

## PREPARATION

### MAKE THE CAKE

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest and juice.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and poppy seeds. Gradually add to the butter mixture, alternating with milk, and mix until well combined. Do not overmix.
4. Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
5. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

### MAKE THE GLAZE

6. In a small bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest until smooth and runny. Drizzle over the cooled cake and let it set before slicing.
7. Enjoy your lemon and poppy seed cake! ðŸ˜‹
