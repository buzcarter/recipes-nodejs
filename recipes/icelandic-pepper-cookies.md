# Icelandic Pepper Cookies
Yield: 36 cookies | Total Time: 45 minutes

By Nissa Krumkake

These spicy and crunchy cookies are a traditional Icelandic treat for the holidays. They are flavored with black pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger, and cut into festive shapes. The dough is easy to work with and holds its shape well during baking. You can decorate these cookies with icing, sprinkles, or sugar pearls, or enjoy them plain with a cup of hot chocolate.

## INGREDIENTS

* 3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup golden syrup
* 1 large egg
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/4 teaspoon ginger

## PREPARATION

1. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add golden syrup and egg and beat well.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. Gradually add to the butter mixture and mix until a smooth dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.
3. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out cookies with your favorite cookie cutters and place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between them.
5. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Decorate the cookies as desired or enjoy them plain. ðŸ˜‹
