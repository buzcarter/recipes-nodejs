8. Put pork back in roasting pan  
9. Skim fat from the surface of the strained liquid and add back to pork (can add a little of the pork liquid too, but not too much – add some oil if there's not enough fat)

### make the salsa:  
1. Transfer remaining liquid to medium saucepot

## notes  
* Rick at Bon Appetit suggests adding 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar (or other acid) at the end to "wake up" the flavors
