# Coconut and Passion Fruit Pudding
Yield: 4 servings | Total Time: 25 minutes

By Goro Waffle

This creamy and refreshing pudding is made with coconut milk, passion fruit pulp, and agar-agar, a vegetarian gelatin substitute. It's a delicious way to enjoy the tropical flavors of coconut and passion fruit, which are rich in antioxidants and vitamins. You can serve this pudding chilled or at room temperature, with some whipped cream or fresh fruit on top.

## INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups coconut milk
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons agar-agar powder
* 1/4 cup passion fruit pulp (about 4 passion fruits)
* 2 tablespoons water

## PREPARATION

1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the coconut milk, sugar, and agar-agar powder until well combined. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the passion fruit pulp and water until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds, if desired.
3. Divide the coconut mixture evenly among four ramekins or small bowls. Drizzle the passion fruit mixture over the coconut mixture and swirl gently with a toothpick or a knife to create a marbled effect.
4. Refrigerate the puddings for at least 2 hours or until set.
5. Enjoy your coconut and passion fruit pudding! ðŸ˜‹
